Omitsis hotels test
===================

Hello world!

In order to complete this test you have to follow these steps:

1) Fork this repository
-----------------------

Fork this repository to your computer or just download the source.

Install Symfony (composer, etc..)

Create a test database:

    php app/console doc:data:create

And create the schema:

    php app/console doc:sch:create

Load fixtures:

    php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load


2) Make a reservation
---------------------

We have created three entities for you:

    * Hotel
    * Room
    * Customer

Hotel and Room have an obvious relation between them (OneToMany).

You have to:
    
    * Create a reservation form: a customer would be able to make a reservation (one room).
    * You cannot make a reservation of a room that is already booked (in a range of dates).
    * Store check-in and check-out date for every reservation on Database.

3) List
-------

We provide with each Hotel a list of their room reservations.

You have to:

    * Create a list of Hotels.
    * Each link takes you to another page with a list of the hotel's reservation.

4) Validate!
------------

To make sure all user data (reservation form) is entered correctly you have to validate both client-side and server-side.
We'd love to see some JS action on this task =)

5) Routes
---------

All these pages have to be connected between them (simple link) and all the options will be avaliable on the web index.


6) Finish
---------

Feel free to add or modify whatever you like on this sample app to simply show us some coding magic ;)

Send us your repository link to check the solution, or just email us your source code: info[at]omitsis[dot]com.

Good luck!
